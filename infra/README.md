# Azure infrastructure for datavault

Bicep templates + a GitHub Actions workflow to provision the Azure SQL Server,
up to three databases (prod/dev/test), and the storage account + RBAC needed
for managed-identity-based external data sources.

## What gets created

- **SQL Server** (`sqlServerName`) with one system-assigned managed identity,
  an AAD admin group, and a secondary SQL auth login (both work side by side).
- **Databases** — `datavault`, `datavault-dev`,
  `datavault-test` — each individually toggleable, all serverless
  General Purpose with auto-pause.
- **Firewall** — only the "Allow Azure Services" rule (0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0) by
  default. A fully-open rule (0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255) is available but
  opt-in only (`allow_all_ips_firewall`) — **not recommended**.
- **Storage account** — either a new one (ADLS Gen2 + a `stage-fs`
  container) or a reference to an existing one, your choice per deployment.
- **RBAC** — grants the SQL Server's managed identity `Storage Blob Data
  Contributor` (or Reader) on the storage account, so `CREATE EXTERNAL DATA
  SOURCE ... CREDENTIAL = [managed_identity]` actually works.

After the Bicep deployment, the workflow also runs
[`../scripts/setup_external_source.sql`](../scripts/setup_external_source.sql)
against each deployed database — this creates the master key, the
`managed_identity` database-scoped credential, the `ParquetFormat` external
file format, and the `StageFileSystem` external data source (matching the
names expected by `models/staging/sources.yml`).

This post-deploy step authenticates with the **SQL admin login** created by
the Bicep deployment (`sql_admin_login` + the `SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` secret) —
the deploying service principal does **not** need to be a member of the AAD
admin group. It reaches the server through the "Allow Azure Services"
firewall rule, which GitHub-hosted runners (running in Azure) pass through.

## One-time setup checklist (do this before the first run)

Everything below is a **one-time setup per environment/subscription**, not
per deployment run. Skip a step if it's already done (e.g. the resource
group or AAD group already exists from a previous project).

Fill in your own values for anything in `<angle brackets>`. Run these with
an account that has enough rights in the subscription (Owner or
User Access Administrator + Contributor) — creating service principals and
role assignments needs more than plain Contributor.

### 1. Register the Azure resource providers (once per subscription)

A fresh subscription has not "activated" every resource type yet — deploying
without this fails with `MissingSubscriptionRegistration`, and the
deployment's own service principal can't fix this itself (it's scoped to a
resource group, not the whole subscription).

```bash
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Sql
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Storage
# wait until both report "Registered" (can take a minute):
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Sql --query registrationState -o tsv
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Storage --query registrationState -o tsv
```

### 2. Create (or identify) the AAD admin group

This group becomes the SQL Server's Azure AD admin. If you already have a
suitable group, just note its name and object ID and skip creating a new one.

```bash
az ad group create \
  --display-name "<sql-admin-group-name>" \
  --mail-nickname "<sql-admin-group-name>"

# add yourself (or whoever should administer the databases):
az ad group member add \
  --group "<sql-admin-group-name>" \
  --member-id "$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)"

# note the object ID for later:
az ad group show --group "<sql-admin-group-name>" --query id -o tsv
```

### 3. Create the resource group

```bash
az group create --name "<resource-group-name>" --location "switzerlandnorth"
```

### 4. Create a service principal for GitHub Actions, scoped to that resource group

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name "<sp-name, e.g. sp-github-datavault>" \
  --role Contributor \
  --scopes "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>"
```

This prints `appId`, `password`, and `tenant` — save them, `password` is
shown only once. Then add the second role (needed for the RBAC step in the
Bicep deployment — plain Contributor is **not** enough for this):

```bash
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "<appId from above>" \
  --role "User Access Administrator" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>"
```

Both roles are scoped to this one resource group only, not the subscription.

### 5. Pick globally unique names, and check them before deploying

SQL Server names and storage account names are unique across **all of
Azure**, not just your subscription — a generic name is very likely already
taken by someone else. The Copier-generated defaults
(`ppmcag-datavault`, `stdatavault001`) are a
starting point, not a guarantee. Check before you deploy:

```bash
az storage account check-name --name "<storage-account-name>"
# SQL server name uniqueness surfaces as a deployment error if taken; there's
# no equivalent standalone check-name command, so pick something distinctive
# (e.g. include your org name) rather than verifying in advance.
```

### 6. Set the 5 required GitHub secrets

```bash
gh secret set AZURE_CLIENT_ID -R <org>/<repo> --body "<appId>"
gh secret set AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET -R <org>/<repo> --body "<password>"
gh secret set AZURE_TENANT_ID -R <org>/<repo> --body "<tenant>"
gh secret set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID -R <org>/<repo> --body "<subscription-id>"
gh secret set SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD -R <org>/<repo> --body "<a-strong-generated-password>"
```

| Secret | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | `appId` from step 4 |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `password` from step 4 (shown once — regenerate with `az ad sp credential reset --id <appId>` if lost) |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | `tenant` from step 4, or `az account show --query tenantId -o tsv` |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | `az account show --query id -o tsv` |
| `SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | You choose this — it becomes the secondary SQL admin login's password. Not recoverable once set (GitHub secrets can't be read back); store it in your password manager too. |

Verify: `gh secret list -R <org>/<repo>` should show all 5.

## How to trigger a deployment

GitHub -> Actions -> **Deploy Azure Infrastructure** -> "Run workflow", then
fill in: resource group, AAD admin group name/object ID (from step 2 above),
which of the three databases to deploy (three separate checkboxes — GitHub
Actions has no true multi-select, so each database is its own toggle), and
whether to create a new storage account or use an existing one.

**Recommended first run:** tick `what_if_only` to preview the changes
(`az deployment group what-if`) before actually applying them.

## After deployment

Run `dbt run-operation stage_external_sources` (from CI or locally) to
actually create the external tables declared in `models/staging/sources.yml`
— the infra workflow only sets up the data source/credential/file format,
not the tables themselves.

## Known rough edges

- **RBAC propagation delay:** Azure role assignments can take a short time
  (usually seconds) to actually take effect. If the external-data-source
  setup step fails immediately after a fresh deployment with a permissions
  error, wait a bit and re-run the workflow — the script is idempotent.
- **Don't disable the "Allow Azure Services" firewall rule** if you use
  GitHub-hosted runners — the post-deploy SQL step (and dbt CI runs) reach
  the server through it. With a self-hosted runner you can replace it with
  a firewall rule for that runner's IP instead.
- **Don't enable Azure-AD-only authentication** on the server
  (`azureADOnlyAuthentication`) unless you also rework the post-deploy SQL
  step — it authenticates with the SQL admin login, which AAD-only mode
  disables.
- **Serverless auto-pause:** a paused database takes a moment to resume on
  first connection. The workflow uses a 60s login timeout to absorb this;
  ad-hoc local connections right after a long idle period may still need a
  retry.
- **Local validation:** `az bicep build --file main.bicep` for a syntax
  check, `az deployment group validate` / `az deployment group what-if`
  against a real (test) resource group before a real deploy.
- **MFA policy vs. local CLI:** Azure now enforces MFA for *user accounts*
  on resource writes — a plain `az login` session may get
  `RequestDisallowedByAzure ... MFA` errors when creating resource groups
  or deploying locally. Re-login interactively with MFA if that happens
  (`az login` without `--use-device-code` if device code flow is blocked by
  a Conditional Access policy — error 53003). The GitHub Actions workflow is
  unaffected: it authenticates as a service principal, and neither MFA nor
  Conditional Access device-registration checks apply to workload identities.
